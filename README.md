# Tutorial
The Tutorial for the Powpoint version can be found in [releases](https://github.com/JoshuaKening/SlicerTractParcellation/releases).
* Start 3D Slicer
* Go to ```TractParcellation``` module
* Install ```WMA```
* Download ```WM atlas``` (optional)
* Select input:
  * Select one of the three input methods
    * ```From Slicer```: Select from ```Input Fiberbundle```
    * ```From File```: Choose file path from ```Input File```
    * ```From Directory```: Choose folder path from ```Input Folder```
* Select output path from ```Output Folder```
* Select the registration mode: ```affine``` or ```affine + nonlinear```
* Decide whether to clear unnecessary intermediate results
* Select the number of threads involved in the computation
* Click ```Apply```
